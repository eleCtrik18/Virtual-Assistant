# Virtual-Assistant(eleCtric)
This is a virtual assistant based on Python it consists of Speech Recognition and Text 2 Speech package.
It requires a wake word "electric" to take response and to perform certain functions.
You can extract date and time of the day from given assistant.
You can also ask for jokes from this assistant by including "Jokes" in your speech.
This Assistant can also fetch data from Wikipedia therefore allowing user to search about a specific person.
Planning to add further features in the assistant.As of writing this, The main issue in this assistant is that response time is much longer than expected and it is not as robust as an assitant should be.
Feel free to contribute if you think you can make some helpful changes.
Thank You
